    "\n",
    "    1. Read the entire Thai article carefully and identify the main points and crucial information.\n",
    "    2. Select key sentences and phrases directly from the original Thai text that best represent the main ideas and crucial details.\n",
    "    3. Arrange the selected Thai sentences or phrases into a coherent and meaningful text in Thai.\n",
    "    4. Ensure the Thai summary is approximately 1/3 to 1/4 of the original article's length.\n",
    "    5. Use only information present in the original Thai text. Do not add any external information or personal interpretations.\n",
    "    6. Maintain the original tone and style of the Thai article in your summary.\n",
    "    7. Adjust the connections between Thai sentences to make the summary read smoothly, while still using words and phrases from the original Thai text as much as possible.\n",
    "    8. Prioritize including specific dates, numbers, and names of key stakeholders when they are central to the article's message.\n",
    "    9. For policy-related articles, focus on capturing the essence of the policy change, its timeline, and its potential impacts in Thai.\n",
    "    10. If the original text contains technical terms or jargon in Thai, include them in the summary with brief explanations if necessary.\n",
    "    11. If the article contains conflicting viewpoints or controversies, ensure these are represented fairly in the Thai summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember, your goal is to create a Thai summary that allows readers to quickly grasp the key points of the original Thai article without having to read the entire text.
