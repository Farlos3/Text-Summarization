      "\n",
      "* Content coverage: The generated summary covers only 50% of the content in the reference summary, missing key points such as the total market capitalization at the end of 2020 and the specific performance of SCGP.\n",
      "* Conciseness: The generated summary is concise, but it's also incomplete. It fails to provide essential information, making it difficult to understand the overall context.\n",
      "* Clarity: The language used in the generated summary is clear, but it's not as accurate as the reference summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Score: 0.6/1\n",
      "\n",
      "The score indicates a moderate level of quality, but with significant room for improvement. The generated summary needs to provide more comprehensive information and accurately convey the details from the original text.\n",
      "Evaluation explanation: The generated summary is quite close to the reference summary. However, there are some minor discrepancies in terms of content coverage and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Score: 0.8\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Content coverage: Both summaries cover the main points of PTT's new business ventures, including New S-Curve, retail business through OR, cafes, and healthcare services. The generated summary also mentions the spin-off plan, which is not present in the reference summary.\n",
      "* Clarity: While both summaries are easy to read, the reference summary provides a clearer structure and uses more concise sentences.\n",
      "* Concision: Both summaries are similar in length, but the reference summary conveys its message more efficiently.\n",
      "* Similarities and differences: The generated summary has some minor errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference summary. For example, it mentions \"PTT ยังรุกธุรกิจร้านคาเฟ่ อเมซอน ที่ประสบความสำเร็จ\" (PTT is also expanding its cafe business, Amazon, which was successful) instead of stating that PTT's cafe business, Amazon, has been successful.\n",
      "\n",

      "* The addition of 6 new tanker vessels to the fleet\n",
      "* The mixed performance of other businesses, including offshore business and ship management business\n",

      "\n",
      "**Content Coverage:** The generated summary covers 80% of the key points in the reference summary, missing some details such as the specific number of cells (40 vs 32) and the mention of a policy (S-Curves).\n",
